2. **Create Post**
   - Logged-in users can create posts with text (and optionally images)  
   - Each post includes:
     - User’s name
     - Post content
     - Time of creation  

3. **View All Posts**

2. After signing up or logging in → redirected to **Feed page**  
3. Users can:
   - Create posts  
   - View everyone’s posts  
   - Like or comment on posts  
   - Edit or delete their own comments
